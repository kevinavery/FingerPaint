The large circle at the bottom center shows the current paint color. Tap this to open and close the color palette.\n\n

The three primary colors (cyan, magenta, yellow) are used to adjust the composition of the current color.
Touch and drag one of these to adjust the amount, as indicated by the green ring around the color.\n\n

The smaller colors at the top are user configured colors. One of them is always selected, and matches the current color.
Switch to another simply by tapping on the color you want.\n\n

Colors can be mixed by tapping the Mix button, and then selecting the colors to be mixed.
When the Mix button is deselected, the new color will be added to the palette, if there is room.
To remove a color from the palette, touch it and hold.
