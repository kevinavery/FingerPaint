FingerPaint
===========

A simple finger painting app for Android, developed as the first homework assignment for CS4962.

The app features a very cool color palette interface, where you can add, remove, tweak, and mix colors dynamically. And when you tap the large color at the bottom, the entire palette slides out of the way.

Here are some screenshots:
